## (Pseudo) Random Numbers:

Random numbers are a sequence of numbers $r_1, r_2, ...r_N$ such that there are no correlations between $r_i$ and $r_j$, where $i,j \in N$. However, computationally, it is not possible to define a sequence of truly random numbers.  One may define pseudorandom numbers on a computer using for example the following equation:

$$r_{i+1} = (a r_{i} + c)~ mod(M)$$

such that $r_{1}$ is a number provided by the user and referred to as "seed". The following python code shows how one may generate their own random numbers (using the linear congruent algorithm):


```python
import math
def genrandom(ri, a, b, M):
    ri1 = (a*ri + b) % M 
    return ri1
```

Using this function, one can generate a sequence random numbers. One notices that the random numbers tends to repeat themselves after a sequence of length M. For instace, the following program shows the sequence of numbers generated by the random number generator:


```python
r, a, b, M = 1, 1, 1, 5 
for i in range(M*3):
    r = genrandom(r,1,1,5)
    print(r)
```


Python comes alongwith modules, such as `random`, `numpy`,  which may be used to generate random numbers. For instance, a uniform sequence of random numbers, that is, random numbers between [0, 1] may be generated by iterating over the following base program: 

```python
import random
random.random()
```


## Monte Carlo Inegration Technique

In order to use the Monte Carlo Integration technique, we use the following observation that an integral $\int_{a}^{b} f(x) dx$ can be written as $\frac{b-a}{N} \Sigma_{i=1}^{N} f(x_i)$, where x_i belong to the phase space over which the integration is carried out. The following is the python implementation of the technique where we integrate the $f(x) = 2x$ with b = 1, a = 0.

```python
import random

def func(x):
    return 2*x

# evaluate f(x_i) at each point and add
Npoint = 100
fi_sum = 0
for i in range(Npoint): # we use 100 points
    fi_sum += func(random.random())

# integration result
b = 1
a = 0
N = Npoint
result = (b-a)/N * fi_sum
print(result)
```
Notice that the obtained result may fluctuate depending on how many number of points are used to integrate.

## Acceptance-Rejection Technique

A common Monte Carlo technique in integrating a fucntion is the acceptance-rejection method which proceeds as follows: 

1. Generate a random number, x uniformly distributed between [xmin, xmax].
2. A second random number, u, is then generated between [0, fmax].
3. Accept x, if u < f(x), otherwise reject x.

    Python based examples to be added for acceptance-rejection method.
